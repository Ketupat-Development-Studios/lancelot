			<p class="flow-text">Every time you want to buy something, the procedure is simple: go online, check the review, make sure the shop isn’t a scam and then go out and buy it. With Carousell, we’ve seen this method transformed as independent sellers can now be reviewed depending on how great their goods are. But why does this have to stop with physical goods?</p>

			<p class="flow-text">The very same convenience and sense of security that Carousell provides is easily replicable in the service industry. If we are looking for a reliable plumber, tutor or electrician, we can’t just go onto craigslist and pick the first guy we see. We often rely on countless reviews and recommendations. By adopting an e-commerce style approach to these physical, real life services, we are able to tap on the experiences of thousands of people every time we want to engage a professional for a service.</p>

			<p class="flow-text">The rating system has several benefits, firstly, it will enhance competition in the services sector and therefore lead to lower prices and higher quality services for consumers. Further, fraudulent and incompetent service providers will quickly be identified as people review their services. Secondly, it will have the added benefit of rewarding the most deserving professionals. The finest electrician in the country will also become the most popular thanks to the ease of accessing reviews. Finally, it will allow everyone to just calm down and rest assured that the plumber they have just called over is not an axe murderer.</p>
